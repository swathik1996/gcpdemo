Starting from their mid-60's garage band roots (sounding amazingly like the Sonics), the Motor City 5 deveoped into an icon for a brand of loud, crushing music reflecting their industrial roots. Even if you don't care for their music (and you're bound to like even a few of their songs), their story is fascinating. It combines 60's protest, youthful braggadocio, and a style of music that would help carry one to the likes of Iggy and the Stooges (not to mention certain aspects of punk rock). This film is clearly a labor of love, combining extraordinarily rare live shows, still shots, a nearly-continuous backdrop of MC5 tunes, penetrating interviews with the remaining members and their spouses, and even FBI surveillance shots.

Embracing radically modernist narrative techniques, Golden Mouth offers a splintered, refractive portrait of brutal masculinity that returns repeatedly to the same moment from different vantages, each time revealing unexpected perspectives on the brutal yet strangely charming criminal. Lurid and disturbing, Golden Mouth delivers a savage satire of marriage and class pretensions, revealing a similar venality at the corroded heart of the sanctimonious bourgeoisie, the moneyed elite and the working class as they all mercilessly claw their way up and down the rickety and ruthlessly hierarchical Brazilian social ladder. -Harvard Film Archive","popularity":0.103347,"poster_path":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/Af1LVeL0yCNGnmmwx4TYUOkHv8p.jpg","production_companies":"[]","production_countries":"[]","release_date":"1963-05-03","revenue":"0","runtime":"100","spoken_languages":"[{'iso_639_1': 'pt', 'name': 'Português'}]","status":"Released","title":"Golden Mouth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":"0"}

HOW SHERLOCK CHANGED THE WORLD will show that Conan Doyle’s hero not only revolutionized the world of fiction, but also changed the real world in more ways than many realize.

In many ways, the modern detective can be seen as a direct extension of Conan Doyle’s literary genius.","popularity":0.011959,"poster_path":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/jeuF0a8B6w9RPxBXY0nrnLgy8HE.jpg","production_companies":"[]","production_countries":"[]","release_date":"2013-10-18","revenue":"0","runtime":"120","spoken_languages":"[{'iso_639_1': 'en', 'name': 'English'}, {'iso_639_1': 'cs', 'name': 'Český'}]","status":"Released","title":"How Sherlock Changed the World","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":"0"}
