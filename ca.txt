Pros:

Enables source control and version history for agents.

Supports code reviews and agent diffs.

Enables collaboration via pull requests and merges.

Helps track changes at file-level granularity.

Leverages familiar developer workflows.

Cons:

Manual sync required — no automatic Git push/pull.

No REST API or SDK support for push/restore.

File count limit — older integrations may fail if agent export contains more than 500 files.

Requires GitHub access token which needs to be stored securely (usually in Secret Manager).

External dependency: access token management often handled by a separate DevOps or platform team.

Private/self-hosted GitHub repositories not supported.

Repository must contain only agent-exported files — any non-agent files are automatically deleted on push.

Error-prone for large or complex agents due to file count limitations.

2️⃣ Upload Local File (Not Recommended)
Pros:

Simple for quick, one-off restores.

No additional setup required.

Convenient for small test agents.

Cons:

Requires elevated permissions for file upload.

Not scalable for large agents or frequent updates.

Fully manual — not CI/CD friendly.

No version control or audit trail.

3️⃣ Cloud Storage (Recommended)
Pros:

Fully automated and scalable.

Handles large agent exports without file count limitations.

Supports CI/CD pipelines and automated workflows.

Compatible with infrastructure-as-code (Terraform, Deployment Manager, custom automation).

No external team dependency — full ownership of service account, GCS permissions, and access stays within AI/Engineering team.

Secure, enterprise-grade solution suitable for LBG environments.

Cons:

Requires initial setup of GCS buckets and secure permissions.

Slight upfront effort to integrate into CI/CD pipelines.

GCS access management must be handled carefully to ensure secure operations.
